# MReSequencing
## Sequencing data for all constructs analysed during Giovanni's MRes. 
The files are in FASTA format. They can be downloaded and analysed in sequencing alignment software. I used Benchling platform which relies on MAFFT software.

To read the files data you can click on the text.file. Alternatively download it to view it on an alignment software.

### Template will read:
> '>Sequence
> 'XXXXXXXXXXX'

### Sequencin data will read:
> '*primer name*
> 'XXXXXXXXXXXX'
Where primer names are
*VF2 (F) = Forward Read
*VF2 (R) = Reverse Read

The primer pairs used for Monomer 2 (GFP) are named below:

*002F and 002F(R)
*008F and 008F(R)
*005R(F) and 005R
*002R(F) and 002R
