# MReSequencing
## Sequencing data for all constructs analysed during Giovanni's MRes. 
The files are in FASTA format. They can be downloaded and analysed in sequencing alignment software. I used Benchling platform which relies on MAFFT software.

To read the files data you can click on the text.file. Alternatively download it to view it on an alignment software.

### Template will read:

Where primer names are

_VF2 (F) = Forward Read_

_VF2 (R) = Reverse Read_

The primer pairs used for Monomer 2 (GFP) are named below: 

_002F and 002F(R)_

_008F and 008F(R)_

_005R(F) and 005R_

_002R(F) and 002R_
