# MReSequencing
## Sequencing data for all constructs analysed during Giovanni's MRes. 
The files are in FASTA format. They can be downloaded and analysed in sequencing alignment software. I used Benchling platform which relies on MAFFT software.

To read the files data you can click on the text.file. Alternatively download it to view it on an alignment software.

#### Primers for all sequences except for Monomer 2 (GFP):

* VF2 (F) = Forward Read_
* VF2 (R) = Reverse Read_

#### Primers for Monomer 2 (GF):

* 002F and 002F(R)
* 008F and 008F(R)
* 005R(F) and 005R
* 002R(F) and 002R
